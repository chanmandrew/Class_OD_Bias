## These are where the splits for AIM_1 will be stored. 

Aim_1 is looking at the "balanced" dataset (43%F/57%M).

Here there will be 3 csv files that have the test, train, and validation sets for the model. 

The combined total should amount to about 26884 images (which is all of the images from the RSNA Pneumonia detection challenge)
