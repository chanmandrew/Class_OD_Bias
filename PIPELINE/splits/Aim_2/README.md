## This is where the csv files for aim_2 are stored

Aim_2 is looking on training on an unbalanced dataset and then testing on males and females and comparing the performance between the two. 

This will be organized by trail (e.g. trial_0) and then further by the percentage of females in the training sets (e.g. 0%F would be training on males whereas 100%F
would be training on only females)

Within each of the subfolders, will be the test, train, and validation datasets.
